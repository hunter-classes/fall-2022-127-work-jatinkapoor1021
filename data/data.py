"""
Worked together with James Chen
pandas was installed through 'pip install pandas'
matplotlib was installed through 'pip install matplotlib'
graphs displayed through 'sudo apt-get install python3-tk' on Ubuntu terminal

Extras done: 2
- Use Matplotlib or another Python graphing/plotting library to
  visualize part or all of your analysis.
- Use multiple aspects of a single data source in your analysis
